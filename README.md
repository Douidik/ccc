ANSI-C compiler written in C++20 supporting very basic C code.
## Work in progress 🔬:
- ### Lexical analysis
	🔴 Pattern matching and regular expression implementation 🔤
	🔴 Lexer engine and tokenization 🗃️
- ### Parser:
	🔴 Abstract system tree, the node structure 🌳
	🔴 Parser engine, tokens to AST 🧠
- ### Compiler
	🔴 AST to code generation
		🔴 x86_64 asm generator
		🔴 6502 asm generator
		🔴 ARM asm generator
